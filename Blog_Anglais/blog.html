                <li> 1 week: </li>
                    <a>The first week was very hard. Really, when i've started i knew the program was too difficult, 100 push-up 100 abdominals, 30 tractions, was impossible so I'd modify it start with 10 push-up and abdo, and only 2 traction. The next day i was aching all over. But i've coninue.</a><br><br>
                <li>2 week:</li>    
                    <a>Week 2 was morely simple, i passed from 10 push-up to 30 in only one week. Moreover, i'd felt no more pain in my body, the exercice became a routine for me </a><br><br>
                <li>3 week:</li>
                    <a>This week I passed from 30 push up to 80 push-up by day, the same for abdominals but for the tractions it was very hard in two week i'd only progresse from 2 tractions to 7. </a><br><br>
                <li>Final Week: </li>
                    <a>The final line, it was too easy i passed from 80 to 100 push-up and abdominals but for the tractions it was very too hard for me at last i'd passed only to 20 tractions </a>

            <p> During my adolescences I met a problem, the problem of taking bad habits like stoped the sport and lets smoking or just don’t care about my proper healthy. As I grew up I realize that habits were going to follow me until I decided to change. So I writing this for those who would like change their life. I made a program for you which consists of replacing a bad routine with a good one. 
                Example: if you are an ex-smoker or just if you want to make progress with your body like gain muscle or stay in shape this challenge is made for you.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this project we are going to do physical exercise during 30 days we’ll call that the 30 day health challenge. So, in it I purpose you a physical program what you can adjust for you. The initial program is to do 100 push-up by day, 100 abdominals, 30 traction  and 100 squat without more charge then yourself, If you are an expert , you can also charging you. For the novice I let you modify the program as yours. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Personally I’ve test the program and I’ve guest some friends of mine to test it and I received only good notices. Personally I was a smoker when I starts the program I wanted to stop smoking to be in shape because I had cardiovascular problem so I replace a routine by another one. At last I stoped to smoke, gain in endurance and in muscle. I was so happy with this program that now it’s been 3 months I still practice. At first, i tell you, it was hard. My body wouldn't follow me so as my lungs but with perseverance i've successful. I've adapting the program to my body it was 10 push-up 10 abdominals and 2 tractions hahaha but trust me the evolution was really amazing. in one week i passed of 10 push-up to 25 push-up, etc.
